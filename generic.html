							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I’m a people person. I have about 12 years of customer service experience. I’ve managed to learn a number of skills such as teamwork experience, ability to work on the pressure, adapt to change and plenty more. I’ve worked such different roles, but I’ve noticed that these are common skills that you would need to survive day-to-day. For example, when handling an upset customer, diffusing the situation is something that takes patience. I’ve managed to always make those negative situations into positive ones. Letting the person know they’re being heard, while dissecting the situation to better help their needs.
						</p>
							<p>Recently, I decided that I wanted to take all these skills and start a new career path. Software engineering is something that’s completely out of my element, but not an impossible concept to grasp. With lots of patience, practice, and reading I’ve recently been improving my technical skills.</p>
							<p>My career goal right now is to continue growing and expanding my tech skills while also contributing to the success of a dynamic and innovative organization. There’s nothing I can’t overcome.</p>
